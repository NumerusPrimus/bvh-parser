# BVH parser

This is a simple parser for BVH (BioVision Hierarchy) character animation file format. It converts the original BVH file to a more readable CSV file to see the frame angle and position data of a joint more clearly on a spreadsheet.

An example motion capture file in BVH format is included in the repo for testing. 

#### Program execution

python bvhparser.py path/to/file
